This is a starting point for Rust solutions to the
["Build Your Own Redis" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/r/funny-cockroach-302153).

In this challenge, you'll build a toy Redis clone that's capable of handling
basic commands like `PING`, `SET` and `GET`. Along the way we'll learn about
event loops, the Redis protocol and more.

**Note**: If you're viewing this repo on GitHub, head over to
